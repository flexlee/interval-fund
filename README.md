Interval Funds: A Comprehensive Analysis of Pricing and Valuation for SEC OversightIntroduction: Understanding Interval FundsInterval funds represent a distinct category within the investment company landscape, characterized by their unique mechanism of periodically offering to repurchase a portion of their outstanding shares from shareholders 1. This repurchase offer, typically conducted at the fund's Net Asset Value (NAV), stands as a fundamental feature differentiating them from other pooled investment vehicles 3. Unlike traditional closed-end funds, the shares of interval funds generally do not trade on any secondary market, such as a stock exchange 2. Furthermore, in a manner akin to open-end mutual funds, interval funds often continuously offer their shares for sale to investors at a price that is directly based on the fund's prevailing NAV 2.The confluence of these characteristics – periodic repurchase offers and continuous issuance at NAV – positions interval funds as a hybrid structure, incorporating elements of both open-end and traditional closed-end funds. This hybridity necessitates a comprehensive understanding of their regulatory obligations and the methodologies employed for valuation. Traditional closed-end funds operate with a fixed number of shares and are traded on exchanges, whereas open-end funds provide daily liquidity to their investors. Interval funds diverge from both models by providing liquidity at predetermined intervals while also engaging in the ongoing issuance of shares. This distinctive operational framework creates a unique regulatory and operational profile that warrants careful consideration by regulatory bodies.A key differentiating factor of interval funds lies in their capacity to invest in less liquid and illiquid assets, a strategy that often underpins their investment objectives 3. Open-end funds, in contrast, typically face limitations on the proportion of illiquid assets they can hold, often capped around 15% of their total assets 6. Traditional closed-end funds issue a finite number of shares that are traded on exchanges, and their market prices can fluctuate, potentially diverging from their NAV 2. These traditional closed-end funds do not typically offer a guaranteed mechanism for periodic liquidity at NAV 3. Interval funds, however, do not trade on exchanges 2. They provide periodic repurchase options to their shareholders, usually on a quarterly basis, at a price equal to the fund's NAV 2. This structure enables them to allocate a significant portion of their portfolios to less liquid and illiquid assets 3. The illiquidity inherent in interval funds, arising from their investment strategies, is a critical aspect that necessitates careful regulatory scrutiny, particularly concerning the valuation of their holdings and the protection of investors.The appeal of interval funds has grown considerably within the investment landscape. They offer individual investors the opportunity to gain exposure to alternative investments, including illiquid strategies and asset classes, which were historically accessible primarily to high-net-worth individuals, hedge funds, and other institutional investors 3. This increased utilization is largely attributed to their capacity to invest in less-liquid assets such as high-yield bonds, private debt, and private equity 6. These types of investments can potentially provide investors with enhanced income and returns compared to more traditional asset classes, while also offering diversification benefits to a portfolio 6. The increasing prevalence of interval funds signifies a broadening of access to alternative investment strategies for a wider range of investors. This trend underscores the importance of diligent regulatory oversight to ensure that these investment products are thoroughly understood by investors and are managed with appropriate rigor and transparency.

Table 1: Comparison of Fund TypesStructure and Key Features of Interval FundsInterval funds exhibit a hybrid structure, effectively merging characteristics of both open-end and closed-end investment companies 16. They share with open-end funds the feature of allowing investors to make daily investments into the fund 16. However, unlike open-end funds that offer daily redemption, interval funds provide liquidity to their investors only at pre-determined, periodic intervals, a characteristic they share with some types of closed-end funds 16. Furthermore, similar to open-end funds, shares of interval funds are offered to investors on a continuous basis and are redeemed at the fund's Net Asset Value (NAV) 5. A significant distinction, however, is that this redemption at NAV is not available on a daily basis 5. From a legal and regulatory standpoint, interval funds are classified as registered closed-end funds under the Investment Company Act of 1940 2. This dual nature necessitates a regulatory framework that carefully considers both the ongoing offering of shares and the limitations on their liquidity to ensure comprehensive oversight.A defining feature of interval funds is their obligation to conduct periodic repurchase offers 3. These offers require the fund to repurchase a specified percentage of its outstanding shares, typically ranging from 5% to 25%, at set time intervals, which are most commonly quarterly but can also be semi-annual or annual 3. It is important to note that shareholders are not obligated to accept these repurchase offers 1. However, the ability of investors to exit the fund is generally limited to these specific repurchase periods 3. If the total number of shares submitted for repurchase exceeds the amount the fund has offered to buy back, the fund may repurchase shares on a pro-rata basis 3. This periodic repurchase mechanism provides a limited form of liquidity for investors in interval funds. Monitoring this mechanism is essential to ensure that funds can meet their repurchase obligations without unduly affecting the remaining portfolio holdings.In contrast to traditional closed-end funds, which typically have a one-time initial public offering (IPO), interval funds continuously offer their shares to investors at a price based on the fund's Net Asset Value (NAV) 2. This continuous offering, similar to that of open-end mutual funds, provides the fund with ongoing flexibility in raising capital and allows them to deploy new capital into investment opportunities as they arise 7. The combination of this continuous offering at NAV and the periodic repurchases also conducted at NAV is a key characteristic that distinguishes interval funds from traditional closed-end funds, which may trade at a market price that represents a premium or a discount to their underlying NAV. This NAV-based pricing mechanism is central to the valuation considerations for interval funds.A primary reason for the establishment and growth of interval funds is their ability to invest in less liquid and illiquid assets 3. Unlike open-end mutual funds, which face restrictions on the amount of illiquid investments they can hold, interval funds generally do not have such strict limitations 6. This flexibility allows interval funds to invest in asset classes that are typically less liquid, such as private equity, real estate, and private debt 5. The core attraction and potential risk of interval funds are intrinsically linked to this ability to invest in less liquid and illiquid assets. This necessitates the implementation of robust valuation methodologies and careful consideration of the potential for issues such as stale pricing and NAV-timing, where the reported NAV may not fully reflect the current market value of the underlying holdings due to the infrequency of trading in those assets.Regulatory Framework: The Investment Company Act of 1940 and Rule 23c-3Under the framework of the Investment Company Act of 1940, interval funds are classified as registered closed-end management investment companies 5. As such, they are subject to the general provisions of the 1940 Act that govern all registered investment companies 2. However, the unique characteristics of interval funds, particularly their periodic repurchase offers, led to the development of specific rules and interpretations under the 1940 Act. This highlights the need for a regulatory approach that is tailored to the specific features of these investment vehicles. While they fall under the closed-end fund classification, their operational model necessitated the creation of Rule 23c-3 to specifically address their periodic liquidity provisions.Rule 23c-3 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 provides the specific regulatory framework for the periodic repurchase offers made by interval funds 2. This rule outlines several key provisions governing the frequency, amount, and timing of these repurchase offers. It specifies that repurchase offers can be made at intervals of every three, six, or twelve months 18. The rule mandates that the amount of common stock the interval fund offers to repurchase must be between 5% and 25% of the fund's outstanding shares 3. Furthermore, Rule 23c-3 sets the deadline for the repurchase payment as seven days after the repurchase pricing date 22. The repurchase pricing date, which is the date on which the fund's NAV is determined for the repurchased shares, must occur no later than 14 days following the repurchase request deadline 22. Additionally, interval funds are required to notify their shareholders of an upcoming repurchase offer between 21 and 42 days prior to the repurchase request deadline 22. Rule 23c-3 provides a structured framework for the limited liquidity offered by interval funds, aiming to strike a balance between providing investors with access to their capital and allowing the fund to pursue its long-term investment strategies.While interval funds have the flexibility to invest in a significant amount of less liquid and illiquid assets, they are still required to maintain sufficient liquid assets to meet their obligations under the periodic repurchase offers 6. Although there is generally no specific limit on the overall amount of illiquid investments an interval fund can hold, Rule 23c-3 mandates that the fund's board of directors must adopt procedures to ensure that the fund has adequate liquidity to comply with its fundamental policy on repurchases 22. This often involves maintaining liquid assets equivalent to at least 100% of the repurchase offer amount 22. The balance between the freedom to invest in illiquid assets, which is a key attraction of interval funds, and the obligation to provide periodic liquidity through repurchases is a critical area for regulatory focus. SEC analysts must carefully assess how interval funds manage this balance to ensure they can meet their commitments to shareholders without compromising the stability and long-term prospects of the fund.Transparency and reporting are integral aspects of the regulatory framework for interval funds. As registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, these funds are subject to various reporting obligations to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) 5. They are required to file regular reports with the SEC, providing transparency into their investment holdings and operational activities 6. Furthermore, interval funds must calculate their Net Asset Value (NAV) at least on a weekly basis. However, for the five business days leading up to a repurchase request deadline, the NAV must be calculated daily 22. These transparency requirements are crucial for enabling both the SEC and investors to monitor the activities, performance, and risk profiles of interval funds, especially considering their investments in assets that may not have readily available market prices. The regular filings and NAV calculations provide essential data points for the SEC to assess the fund's compliance with regulations, monitor for potential risks, and ensure that investors have access to relevant and timely information about their investments.Liquidity Considerations and Investor ImplicationsInterval funds offer a significantly different liquidity profile compared to traditional open-end mutual funds. Unlike open-end funds, which provide daily liquidity allowing investors to redeem their shares on any business day, interval funds do not offer this level of immediate access to capital 3. Instead, the opportunities for investors to sell their shares back to the fund are restricted to the periodic repurchase offers conducted by the fund 3. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that an investor will be able to redeem the full amount of shares they wish to sell during a repurchase period, particularly if the total requests for repurchase exceed the amount the fund has offered to buy back. In such cases, the fund may repurchase shares on a pro-rata basis, meaning investors might receive only a portion of their requested redemption 3. Additionally, unlike traditional closed-end funds that may trade on a secondary market, it is generally not expected that a secondary market will develop for the shares of interval funds 9. The limited liquidity inherent in interval funds is a fundamental characteristic that prospective investors must fully understand before committing their capital. Regulatory oversight by the SEC should prioritize ensuring clear and prominent disclosure of this liquidity limitation in all relevant fund documents and investor communications.Given the restricted opportunities for selling shares, an investment in an interval fund should be viewed as a long-term commitment 6. These funds are generally most suitable for investors who have a longer investment time horizon and do not anticipate needing immediate or frequent access to the capital invested 11. The illiquid nature of interval funds necessitates that investors adopt a long-term perspective. Regulatory guidance may emphasize the importance of financial professionals conducting thorough suitability assessments to ensure that these types of investments align with their clients' individual time horizons and liquidity needs. Investors need to be comfortable with the possibility of their capital being potentially locked up for extended periods, as the periodic repurchase offers may be infrequent and may not accommodate all redemption requests.One of the potential benefits that may attract investors to interval funds is the opportunity to access the "illiquidity premium" 7. Less liquid and illiquid assets often have the potential to generate higher levels of income and returns compared to more traditional, liquid investments 6. This is based on the principle that investors typically demand a higher yield or return in exchange for accepting a lower degree of liquidity in their investments 7. Interval funds can provide individual investors with access to this potential premium, which might otherwise be available only through less accessible investment vehicles 9. While the prospect of higher returns through the illiquidity premium can be appealing, it is crucial to recognize that this potential reward is accompanied by the inherent risks associated with the limited liquidity of the underlying investments. Regulatory bodies like the SEC may focus on ensuring that the potential benefits are presented to investors in a balanced manner, alongside a clear and comprehensive explanation of the associated risks, particularly the limitations on liquidity.The limited redemption opportunities inherent in interval funds introduce specific risks for investors. The foremost risks include the limited liquidity windows and the predetermined number of shares that the fund offers to repurchase at each interval 11. There is no guarantee that investors will be able to sell their shares in a timely manner if an unexpected need for cash arises between repurchase periods 9. Furthermore, even during a scheduled repurchase offer, there is a risk that an investor may not be able to tender all or any of their requested fund shares, especially if the repurchase offer is oversubscribed 3. These limitations on redemptions create a liquidity risk for investors, meaning they might not be able to access their invested capital when they need it or at a price they find advantageous. SEC analysis of interval funds should carefully consider how these funds disclose and manage this liquidity risk, particularly in scenarios of market volatility or economic stress, where a higher volume of investors might seek to redeem their shares.Pricing and Valuation of Interval Funds: Principles and PracticesThe pricing of shares in an interval fund is primarily based on the fund's Net Asset Value (NAV). Typically, interval funds calculate and report their NAV on a daily basis, similar to open-end mutual funds 5. The purchase and repurchase of shares in an interval fund occur at this NAV 3. Given that there is typically no secondary market trading for interval fund shares, the NAV serves as the fundamental metric for determining the price at which investors can buy into the fund and the proceeds they receive when selling shares back to the fund during a repurchase offer. Therefore, the accurate and timely calculation of NAV is of paramount importance for ensuring fair transactions for all shareholders.Interval funds typically price their shares daily at the Net Asset Value (NAV) 10. The NAV per share is calculated by taking the total value of the fund's assets, subtracting its total liabilities, and then dividing this amount by the total number of outstanding shares 13. This calculation is generally performed at the end of each business day, often coinciding with the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange 28. All expenses and fees associated with the fund's operation, including the management fee, are accrued on a daily basis and are taken into account when determining the NAV 28. This daily NAV calculation provides investors with a regular indication of the underlying value of their investment in the fund, even though their ability to liquidate their holdings is limited to the periodic repurchase windows. This practice underscores the necessity for robust accounting and valuation processes to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the reported NAV.A critical aspect of determining the NAV of an interval fund involves the valuation of the securities held within its portfolio. For those securities for which readily available market quotations exist, the fund will typically use the market value to determine their worth 29. However, due to the nature of interval funds investing in less liquid and illiquid assets, a significant portion of their portfolio may consist of securities for which such market quotations are not readily available. In these instances, the fund is required to determine the fair value of these securities in good faith 29. This fair value determination is conducted according to the fund's established valuation procedure 28. The process of fair value determination is particularly significant for interval funds because of their holdings in assets that lack frequent trading activity. SEC analysts must therefore pay close attention to the processes and oversight mechanisms that interval funds have in place for these valuations.The ultimate responsibility for the valuation of portfolio investments for which market quotations are not readily available rests with the fund's board of directors 12. The board is tasked with ensuring that these valuations are made in good faith and in accordance with the fund's valuation procedures. While the board retains this oversight responsibility, it is common for the board to delegate the day-to-day responsibility for performing fair value determinations to certain parties, most often the fund's investment adviser or manager 12. In such cases, the adviser may be designated as the valuation designee and is authorized to utilize the services of independent third-party pricing and valuation firms to assist in this process 28. This governance structure, involving both the oversight of the board and the potential delegation of valuation tasks to the adviser, with possible support from independent experts, is intended to ensure a robust and impartial assessment of the fund's asset values. The effectiveness of this oversight is a critical area for review by the SEC to safeguard investor interests.Valuation of Illiquid Assets: Methodologies and ChallengesValuing assets for which readily available market quotations do not exist presents several challenges. Illiquid assets, by their very nature, trade infrequently, which makes it difficult to ascertain their true market value at any given time 17. The process of valuing these assets often involves a degree of complexity and subjectivity, as it may rely on estimations, assumptions about future performance, and comparisons to similar, potentially more liquid, assets 17. The lack of frequent trading data introduces a level of uncertainty into the valuation process, which can lead to potential discrepancies between the estimated fair value and the value that might ultimately be realized upon a future sale. This inherent uncertainty in the valuation of illiquid assets is a key consideration for both fund managers and regulatory bodies.To enhance the objectivity and expertise in the valuation of illiquid assets, interval funds often rely on independent third-party valuation firms 17. These firms specialize in providing assessments of the fair value of assets that lack readily observable market prices. Their independent evaluation is crucial for maintaining investor confidence in the transparency and objectivity of the overall valuation process 17. Fund managers, often acting under the oversight of the fund's board, may engage these valuation specialists to conduct regular reviews of the valuation models and the resulting valuations, sometimes even on a daily basis 27. The involvement of independent third-party valuation firms adds a significant layer of scrutiny to the valuation process, helping to mitigate potential biases and providing a more credible assessment of the fund's underlying asset values.In determining the fair value of illiquid assets, interval funds often adhere to established fair value accounting standards, such as those outlined in FASB ASC 820 Fair Value Measurement 26. This accounting standard provides a framework for measuring fair value, aiming to increase consistency and comparability across financial reporting. The daily Net Asset Value (NAV) of an interval fund is typically determined using a valuation policy that has been approved by the fund's board and is consistent with these fair value accounting principles 26. Adherence to such standards provides a structured approach to fair value measurement, guiding the selection of appropriate valuation techniques and the inputs used in these techniques.One of the risks associated with investing in illiquid assets is the potential for "stale pricing," where the reported prices of assets may not fully reflect the most current market information due to the infrequency of trading 26. This can lead to "NAV-timing" risks, where investors who enter or exit the fund based on these potentially outdated prices could inadvertently transfer wealth to or from existing buy-and-hold investors 26. Interestingly, the periodic repurchase structure that is characteristic of interval funds can, to some extent, mitigate these NAV-timing risks that might arise from stale pricing 37. The quarterly or semi-annual nature of the repurchase offers aligns the valuation points for redemptions more closely with the less frequent trading patterns of illiquid assets, potentially reducing the opportunity for arbitrage based on stale prices compared to investment vehicles that offer more frequent liquidity.Case Study: ARKVX Interval Fund - Pricing and ValuationThe ARK Venture Fund (ARKVX) serves as a relevant case study for understanding the pricing and valuation dynamics of an interval fund, particularly one with a significant focus on less liquid assets like private equities. ARKVX is an actively managed, closed-end interval fund with the stated investment objective of seeking long-term growth of capital 38. The fund pursues this objective by investing in both private and public equity securities of companies that are considered relevant to the theme of disruptive innovation 38. A key aim of ARKVX is to broaden access to venture capital investments, allowing a wider range of investors to participate in what are perceived as highly innovative companies throughout their private and public market lifecycles 38. The fund's investment focus spans areas such as neural networks, reusable rockets, adaptive robotics, precision therapies, next-generation cloud computing, and digital wallets 38. Given its investment strategy, which includes a substantial allocation to private equity, ARKVX provides a valuable example for examining the valuation challenges associated with illiquid assets within the interval fund structure.An analysis of ARKVX's financial details reveals its fee structure and operating expenses. As of a specific date, the fund reported total annual fund expenses of 4.71%, which were partially offset by an expense reimbursement of 1.81%, resulting in total fees of 2.90% 38. It is important to note that expense ratios can fluctuate over time 39. Within these total expenses, the management fee charged by the fund's advisor, ARK Investment Management LLC, is 2.75%, the service fee is 0.15%, and other operating expenses account for 1.81% 38. The relatively high expense ratio observed in ARKVX is not uncommon for interval funds that invest in less liquid assets. This typically reflects the higher costs associated with active management, including the potentially more complex and resource-intensive processes involved in the valuation of these types of holdings. While these higher fees can impact the overall return for investors, they are often considered a trade-off for the potential access to unique investment opportunities and the prospect of higher returns associated with less liquid asset classes.ARKVX calculates and reports its Net Asset Value (NAV) on a daily basis 38. As of a particular date, the NAV per share was reported as $30.21 38. However, it's important to note that this NAV is subject to daily fluctuations based on the performance of the fund's underlying investments 39. The fund's prospectus provides details regarding the process by which the NAV is calculated 28. This daily reporting of NAV is a significant aspect of transparency for ARKVX investors, providing them with regular updates on the fund's value, especially considering the illiquid nature of a substantial portion of its holdings and the limited opportunities for redemption. Even though investors cannot trade their shares daily, the daily NAV serves as a crucial indicator of the fund's performance and provides a benchmark for the periodic repurchase offers.An examination of ARKVX's portfolio composition reveals that it holds a significant portion of its assets in private equities. As of a specific date, approximately 82.97% of the fund's market value was allocated to private investments, with the remaining 17.03% in public equities 38. The fund's prospectus outlines the policies governing the valuation of its portfolio holdings, stating that the Board of Trustees holds the ultimate responsibility for valuing investments for which readily available market quotations do not exist. These valuations are to be determined in good faith, following the procedures established in the fund's valuation policy 28. The fund's investment adviser, ARK Investment Management LLC, acts as the valuation designee and is authorized to utilize the services of independent third-party pricing and valuation services in carrying out these responsibilities 28. Given ARKVX's substantial allocation to private equities, understanding its process for determining the fair value of these illiquid holdings is particularly important for SEC analysts. A thorough review of the fund's valuation procedures, as well as the role and qualifications of any third-party valuators involved, would be prudent. Valuing private equity investments involves considerable judgment and often requires the application of various valuation techniques, such as discounted cash flow analysis and comparable company analysis. SEC oversight in this area likely focuses on assessing the reasonableness, consistency, and documentation of the valuation methods employed by the fund.ARKVX, being structured as an interval fund, has established a schedule for offering to repurchase its shares from investors. The fund typically conducts these repurchase offers on a quarterly basis, with the expectation of repurchasing up to 5% of its outstanding shares at each interval 24. A detailed repurchase calendar, outlining the specific dates for these offers, is made available on the fund's website 38. During these scheduled quarterly periods, shareholders have the opportunity to tender their shares for repurchase by the fund at the prevailing Net Asset Value (NAV) 41. This quarterly repurchase offer, with a target repurchase amount of 5%, provides a predictable mechanism for liquidity, albeit a limited one, for investors in ARKVX. SEC review of the fund might include an assessment of its ability to consistently meet these repurchase obligations, particularly in light of its significant holdings in less liquid private equity investments. The announced repurchase schedule allows investors to plan for potential redemptions, but the 5% limit suggests that if there is high demand for repurchases, not all investors may be able to sell their desired amount of shares in a given quarter.SEC Reporting Requirements for Interval FundsInterval funds, like other registered investment companies, are subject to specific reporting requirements mandated by the SEC. Two key forms relevant to understanding their operations and portfolio composition are Form N-PORT and Form N-CEN. Form N-PORT requires registered investment companies to submit detailed information about their portfolio holdings on a quarterly basis, with monthly breakdowns of certain data 42. While the current reporting frequency is quarterly, amendments to the rule are moving towards a monthly reporting requirement 43. This form is designed to provide the SEC with timely and comprehensive data regarding a fund's complete portfolio holdings, as well as information related to portfolio risk, liquidity, and the use of derivatives 44. ARKVX is required to file Form N-PORT, making this information available to the SEC for regulatory oversight 48. These filings are a critical source of information for the SEC to regularly monitor the portfolio composition, risk exposures, and liquidity profiles of interval funds such as ARKVX. The detailed holdings data allows the SEC to analyze the types of assets held, assess potential concentrations of risk, and evaluate the overall liquidity management of the fund.Form N-CEN is another important SEC filing for registered investment companies, including interval funds. This form is filed annually and requires the reporting of census-type information about the fund and its related counterparties, such as brokers, transfer agents, and pricing agents 42. Form N-CEN replaced the previous Form N-SAR and aims to streamline the reporting of this type of information 47. Recent amendments to Form N-CEN now also require funds subject to the SEC's liquidity rule to report specific information about any third-party service providers they utilize to comply with that rule, particularly those providing liquidity classification services 43. ARKVX is also required to file Form N-CEN on an annual basis 48. This form provides the SEC with essential structural information about the interval fund and its key service providers, including those involved in valuation and liquidity management. Understanding these relationships is vital for the SEC to assess potential conflicts of interest and the robustness of the fund's operational processes.The SEC has recently adopted amendments to the reporting requirements for registered investment companies, including those for Form N-PORT 43. These amendments will increase the frequency of filing Form N-PORT from quarterly to monthly and will also compress the timeframe within which these reports must be submitted 43. The compliance dates for these amendments are set for 2025 and 2026, depending on the size of the fund group 43. The primary objective of these changes is to enhance the SEC's ability to monitor market trends more closely, identify potential risks in the asset management industry earlier, and engage more effectively with the Financial Stability Oversight Council 43. This move towards more frequent and detailed reporting through Form N-PORT underscores the SEC's ongoing commitment to strengthening its oversight of the asset management industry, with a particular focus on areas such as liquidity and risk management, which are especially relevant for interval funds given their investment strategies and liquidity profiles.Conclusion and Key Considerations for SEC AnalystsInterval funds present a unique investment structure that blends features of both open-end and closed-end funds, offering periodic liquidity while often investing in less liquid and illiquid assets. Their pricing and valuation mechanisms, primarily centered around the Net Asset Value (NAV), are critical for ensuring fair transactions for investors. The daily calculation of NAV, even with limited redemption opportunities, provides a degree of transparency, but the valuation of illiquid holdings remains a significant area requiring careful scrutiny. The role of the board of directors in overseeing the valuation process, and the potential involvement of valuation designees and independent third-party firms, are important elements of this oversight framework.For SEC analysts, a thorough understanding of the valuation policies and procedures of interval funds is paramount. Due diligence in reviewing how these funds, particularly those with substantial holdings in illiquid assets like private equities, determine fair value is essential. This includes examining the methodologies employed, the qualifications and independence of any third-party valuators, and the robustness of the board's oversight.Potential areas of focus for SEC oversight and analysis of interval funds include:
Liquidity Management: Assessing whether the fund maintains sufficient liquid assets to meet its repurchase obligations under Rule 23c-3, especially in varying market conditions.
Valuation Practices: Reviewing the fund's policies and procedures for fair value determination, ensuring compliance with relevant accounting standards, and evaluating the reasonableness of the valuation methodologies used for illiquid assets.
Transparency and Disclosure: Ensuring that investors are provided with clear and comprehensive information regarding the fund's liquidity limitations, investment strategies, valuation practices, and fee structure.
NAV Accuracy: Monitoring the accuracy and timeliness of the daily NAV calculation, particularly given the challenges associated with valuing illiquid holdings.
Compliance with Reporting Requirements: Ensuring timely and accurate filing of required SEC forms, including Form N-PORT and Form N-CEN, and understanding the implications of recent amendments to these reporting rules.
By focusing on these key areas, SEC analysts can effectively oversee interval funds, ensuring investor protection and maintaining the integrity of the market for these increasingly significant investment vehicles.

## ChatGPT Slides

Interval Funds: Pricing & Valuation
Example: ARK Venture Fund (ARKVX)
Slide 1: What is an Interval Fund?
Closed-end fund offering periodic share repurchases directly from investors.
Shares priced at Net Asset Value (NAV); no secondary market trading.
ARKVX Example:
NAV calculated daily.
Quarterly repurchase offers (at NAV).
Slide 2: General Pricing Methodologies
NAV = (Assets – Liabilities) ÷ Shares Outstanding
Publicly traded assets: Market prices used daily.
Private/illiquid assets: Fair Value determined in good faith.
Valuation methods:
Recent transaction prices
Comparable company analysis
Discounted cash flow (DCF)
Independent third-party appraisals
ARKVX employs external valuation services under Board oversight.
Slide 3: SEC Regulatory Requirements
Investment Company Act of 1940 & Rule 2a-5:
Assets with market quotations: Must use market prices.
Assets without quotations: Fair value determination by Fund’s board or designated adviser.
Rule 2a-5: Advisers can act as valuation designee under board supervision.
Interval Fund Specific Rules (Rule 23c-3):
Repurchase intervals: minimum twice yearly.
Repurchase amount: 5% to 25% of outstanding shares.
Pricing: Shares repurchased at NAV.
Payment within 7 days post valuation.
Slide 4: Historical Pricing Trends of ARKVX
Launch: September 2022 (~$20 NAV)
Current NAV (2025): ~$30/share (+50% since inception)
Annualized performance: ~15% since inception
Key performance drivers:
Positive: Anthropic, Epic Games, Coinbase, Robinhood (private & public positions)
Negative: Flexport, Freenome, 10x Genomics, Unity Software
NAV volatility lower vs. public market funds:
Private valuations updated intermittently, reducing volatility.
Slide 5: Impact of Liquidity & Redemption Rules
Interval structure = Limited Liquidity
Quarterly redemption: Typically limited to 5% per quarter (minimum allowed by SEC).
Valuation Implications:
Fund can invest significantly in illiquid assets (up to ~85% for ARKVX).
NAV reflects orderly transaction estimates—not forced sale/liquidation prices.
Liquidity managed via portfolio mix (public holdings provide cash for repurchases).
Investors accept limited liquidity for potential long-term NAV growth.
Slide 6: ARKVX Prospectus & SEC Filing Insights
Valuation Procedure clearly outlined:
Board oversight, adviser as valuation designee.
Independent pricing services engaged for illiquid assets.
Transparency in Reporting:
Detailed annual and semiannual filings (N-CSR/N-PORT).
Performance drivers clearly communicated.
Disclosure of valuation adjustments (both positive and negative).
Liquidity & Risk Disclosure:
Prospectus emphasizes risks due to illiquidity and valuation uncertainty.
Fund’s NAV represents best estimate—not guaranteed exit value.
Slide 7: Summary & Takeaways
Interval funds balance illiquidity (venture/private assets) and periodic liquidity (repurchase offers).
Valuation based on rigorous, regulated process (SEC Rule 2a-5 compliance).
ARKVX demonstrates clear valuation methodologies, transparency in reporting, and deliberate liquidity management.
Investors must understand NAV is an estimated fair value subject to periodic adjustments.
